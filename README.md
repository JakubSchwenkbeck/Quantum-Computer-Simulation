# **Quantum Simulator in Rust**
This project is a simple quantum computer simulator implemented in Rust. It allows users to explore basic quantum operations on qubits, such as applying **Hadamard**, **Pauli-X**, and **Pauli-Z** gates, and measuring **qubit** states. The application features a graphical interface built with eframe and egui, providing a visual representation of the qubit's state on the Bloch sphere.

**Features:**
- Create and manipulate qubits.
- Apply quantum gates (Hadamard, Pauli-X, Pauli-Z).
- Measure qubit states with probabilistic outcomes.
- Visualize the qubit state on the Bloch sphere, including coordinates and probabilities.
